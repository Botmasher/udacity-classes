HTML5 Canvas

BASICS
- adding charts, maps, art: can do with CSS or Flash, but Canvas is easier
- Set of functions for shapes, patterns, animations
- Going to make memes in this class

- Canvas tag with optional width and height to allocate space on page
<canvas id="c" width="250" height="250"></canvas>

- Grab canvas from JS code
<script>
var c = document.querySelector("#c");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d"); 			// or "3d", but not in this class
</script>

- now use methods to start drawing!
- use coordinates to figure out where to draw (0,0 is top left)
